Names: Dayton Schuh, Kenji Avila, Yanjie Shi, Darren Vu

Languages: C / C++

How-to: 
	1. Access a linux-based system.
	2. Open two independent terminals. 
	3. Make sure that the terminals are in the same, correct directory. If not, navigate both terminals to the correct directory using: cd  <directory>.
	4. In the first terminal, run the command: make
	5. Then, in the same terminal, run the command: ./recv
	6. In the second terminal, run the command: ./sender file.txt
	7. The program should have sent the file to recvfile.txt

Extra Credit: No attempt.
